#### Feedback

The most important part about creating a role is improving it and adjusting very tiny bits of it to fit perfectly into the game.

Join our [discord](https://discord.gg/wwo) and post your role in _#role-ideas_. You will receive feedback from people and please consider that feedback. It is only gonna be a good role if you work on it with other people.

#### Voting

After designing the part that will decide what happens to your outfit is the voting.
I recommend to post your design in _#avatar-ideas_ on our discord before submitting it for voting since you cannot change your submission once submitted.

This is the voting gallery

<script>
    function f3(){
        document.getElementById('replaceMe3').innerHTML='<iframe src=\"https://voting-gallery.werewolf-apps.com/" style=\"width:100%;height:1000px\"></iframe>'
    }
</script>
<div id="replaceMe3" onClick="f3()">
<center onclick="f3()"><a><b>Click to load</b></a></center>
</div>

+ An outfit with a rating over 3.9 will most likely be used for a clan quest.
+ An outfit with a very good rating (somewhere above 4.2) will get added to the limited sales.
