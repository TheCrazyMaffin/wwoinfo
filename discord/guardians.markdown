### You got banned?

Thats pretty unfortunate. 

+ Do you think the reason you got banned for isnt justified
+ Don't you know why you got banned at all
+ Any other ban related questions?

then please contact our guardians.

1. They will **only** reply on discord. Join our [discord](https://discord.gg/wwo). If you cannot use discord theres no way to talk to the guardians about your ban.
2. Ask in _#questions_ about who to contact. Contact **one** person at a time. They get lots of direct messages but will eventually reply.

#### Things to consider

+ Guardians have most likely reviewed reports before banning you.
+ Guardians can see what happens ingame, also after the game.
+ Guardian have the final saying when it comes to bans, when they deny an unban its denied, no discussion needed.
